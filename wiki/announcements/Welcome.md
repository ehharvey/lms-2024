Welcome to lms-2024! This is a software project for rookies, maintained by rookies :) It will be a Learning Management System (e.g., for elearning).

If you stumbled on this project and want to participate, consider  filling out this form :) https://forms.gle/8Bvcr6vQD2wErg7Q7

My name is Emil and I am currently the project creator and maintainer! I've just about set everything up to get started.

# Overview
1. I'm thinking 1 week iterations (meaning that we all work for about a week then review and discuss). There's many resources online about this practice, like this wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development
2. Currently, the project will start as a 'CLI' (console text app) before becoming a web app. My hope is to start be as inclusive as possible; literally the first iteration will require you to make a 'Hello World' type program.
3. This is something new that I'm trying, so there may be difficulties as we figure things out. The important thing here is if you are finding difficulties, **please let me know**. It's easy for me to miss issues that others are having. On my end, I'll try to do the same and also be welcoming of any criticism or feedback :)

# This iteration
1. I will be taking over setting up the initial project code. I'll also make a short document that describes what this project's practices are. I'll be pushing both of these things straight to main now, but in the future, I'm hoping to get peer review on any new code or documentation.
2. Speaking of documentation, check out our `wiki/` folder :). I'm hoping to use the Obsidian app for our wiki.
3. I'm not 100% sure on what our app should be in these first few weeks. In general, I'm deciding between something targeted at students (e.g., a work tracker) _or_ something targeted at teachers (grade tracker). I'll make a poll for this for us to discuss. If folks here are also so against a learning management system in general, I'm all ears for a different topic! (But I have the final say hahahaha).

Let's build and learn together!!

# What should I do?
1. Check out the issues, add comments/assign yourself to some :)
