Hello, everyone! Welcome.

As this project gets started, we should decide what we actually want to build :smiling_face_with_tear: !

Mainly, I wanted to get some feedback about our project direction before we get too far into something that people don't like.

Here are thoughts:
# Overall
1. I think we should build something similar to D2L. I think this is a concept familiar to many of us, is feasible, and gives us things to think about (multiple kinds of users, etc.)
2. I think we should make something that is more general. That is, D2L seems built for existing schools. It might be cool to make something that is more social; as in _anyone_ could provide instructional materials and _anyone_ can participate
3. When starting out, I think we should start small. D2L is used by both _students_ and _teachers_. I think our project should start only looking at _students_ or _teachers_ (we'll consider the other type of user later!)

What are your thoughts? See poll below.

## Concepts
If we decide to make an LMS type system, we should start by either making something for students or something for teachers. Here are my ideas:
### Student 
1. A work-tracking app (add homework, add progress towards homework, etc.). Think of it as a homework organizer
### Teacher
1. Grade tracking app
2. Course outline tracking (maybe something that ensures that the lessons build on previous lessons, etc.)
