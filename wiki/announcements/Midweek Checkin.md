Hi everyone!

Hope you are doing well :) This post is just a quick checkin and also includes some updates.

First off, congratulations to @ghostp13409 , @boa-im , and @Nimesh2099 for your successful pull requests :tada: !!!

* #62 

# Updates:
## Folks needing help with git
Some folks have asked me for help with git. Definitely something I should have included in the survey/anticipated :laughing: .
* I have a (40 min!) screen cast video [here](https://youtu.be/4xZaxwmNqJQ), however
* I understand some people might prefer something written. I will hopefully get around to this on Friday or Saturday. If someone is willing, there is #63 up for grabs! I would definitely appreciate if someone else wrote it up!

## Remember to commit to your issues :)
There was a situation where someone accidentally committed to the same branch as another when they should have created another branch. I definitely see that all the hello wiki and hello credits branches are super confusing. Be sure to double check that the issue you are working on is assigned to you! (If it isn't assigned to anyone, please self-assign so that folks know you're working on it). Hopefully, next week we'll work on less 'everyone' issues, so this problem _should_ decrease.

In any case, this was a great opportunity to showcase **merge conflict resolution** and **git cherry picking**! If you're interested, check these videos out!

## Work still needing to be done
There are some issues still open for grabs (including the documentation one mentioned above). These are:
#63 
#22 
#17 
#25 
#48 

I have been debating whether we could extend these. I think we need to get them done before next iteration: otherwise we are gonna have issues when we implement real features.

If anyone wants, they can take one or more! I **will warn** that they are somewhat tricky and I have strong opinions about how they should be implemented. So, if anyone is interested, please consider checking with me before starting implementation.

If no one gets to these, I will on Sunday or Monday :)

## Poll will end this Saturday
Thanks to the mysterious voter on #29 ! I do want to get folks' opinions about how this project should go. **I do really like the idea of student-focused app to start with**, but I will always consider your feedback :)
