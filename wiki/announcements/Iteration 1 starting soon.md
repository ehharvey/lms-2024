title: Iteration 1 starting soon!
---
Hello, everyone!

Our first sprint (or work period) is starting soon! This project is going to use a **weekly** cycle starting on **Wednesdays**. This means:
* Try to avoid working before Wednesday. Instead, you can assign yourself to issues.
* If there is an issue that someone else took that you are also interested in, consider leaving a comment there. Maybe there can be some wiggle room :) I may also be able to figure out a way to split up tasks
* From Wednesday day up until Tuesday, you are free to start coding on **your assigned issues**

As a general reminder:
* Try to use **1 branch per issue**. I know this is tedious, especially in the first few weeks. However, it makes my life super easy and your future employers will love you if you mention that you do this
* I'll reach out to folks to any issues that I think are at-risk or are on unassigned, usually on Thursday or Friday. I'm always happy to push issues to the next week, but I do need to keep progress up so that we can all work on fun things later on :)
* I reserve the right to reassign work, but I promise not to be mean about it haha. Again, I'm here to keep things fun for everyone.

Best of luck in this first week!

PS: join the slack!
