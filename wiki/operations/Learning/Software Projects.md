- **Dependency Management**: How to declare and manage external libraries or packages in a way that is reproducible and compatible.
- **Build Automation**: Using tools like Make, Gradle, Webpack, or other CI/CD tools to automate testing, building, and deployment.
- **Version Control**: Best practices for Git, including branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow), commit message conventions, and collaboration workflows.
- **Documentation**: Emphasizing the importance of README files, code comments, and project documentation in the structure.
