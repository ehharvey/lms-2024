This page has notes about `git`, including what it is and how to use it.
# Overview
`git` is a tool used to manage code. A  `git` "repository" is simply a folder of code that is "version-controlled"; meaning having versions, etc. Software developers use `git` for many reasons, including:
1. Controlling how changes get incorporated into the code. In general, we want to make sure all new changes are double checked!
2. Rolling back changes. Maybe a bug got introduced and we need to rollback!
3. Knowing who made a specific change to the code. This can help us know who to ask about a particular piece of code.
4. `git` != GitHub! GitHub is an "online repository host" for `git`, meaning that it can store your `git` repositories online!
	* We sync our code with GitHub to share our code with others. This means that when coding, we continually *pull* changes from GitHub (usually from other people) and *push* changes to GitHub.

# Getting Started
1. Install `git`  from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. Set up your identity. See [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for instructions
3. Ensure you are authenticated with GitHub. See [[GitHub CLI]] for one way to do this.
